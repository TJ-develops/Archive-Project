# Archive-Project
A structured archival platform for documenting major public-interest cases, individuals, organizations, and investigative timelines.

Designed as a research-grade, archive-style system — not a blog, not a news site, not a dashboard.

# Overview

ARCHIVE is a structured investigative index built to:

Document major criminal cases

Track individuals (“Figures”) connected to investigations

Maintain timelines and documented events

Store evidence references and legal documents

Present structured, readable, research-focused content

The UI is intentionally minimal and institutional — inspired by legal archives and structured intelligence repositories.
